                    <p>
                        Monopole towers are made of tapered steel tubes that fit together to form a
                        stable pole. They can be self-supported or guyed and may have climbing rungs.
                        The sections of the tower should be made of heavy duty steel or low-alloy
                        high-strength steel, and the joints should be designed to have a minimum overlap
                        of 1.5 times the pole diameter. The pipes should be tapered and made of
                        galvanized steel, and the tower can be designed with a variety of configurations
                        and finishes to meet local aesthetic requirements. The depth of the overlap, the
                        base width, and the number of pipes in the tower are determined based on the
                        expected height of the tower, the thickness of the pipe walls, the base
                        diameter, and whether the tower will be guyed or self-supported.

                        Guyed towers are structures that are supported and stabilized by tethered wires.
                        They may be constructed in various forms, such as lattice, triangular or square,
                        tapered or straight, or monopole. When installing guyed towers, it is important
                        to use pre-stretched steel for the guy ropes and to avoid over-tightening the
                        wires in order to prevent alignment issues, cable rupture, and permanent
                        wrapping of tower structural parts. The strength of the guy wires must be
                        sufficient to withstand the maximum tension that is likely to occur under the
                        worst loading conditions.

                        without the need for additional support, such as guy wires. These towers are
                        typically made in the form of a lattice structure, with a triangular or square
                        shape. The legs of the tower may be made of tube, angle, lattice, or solid round
                        materials, and the sections may be made of steel angles or steel tubes. The
                        tower may also feature steel angle cross bracing and tapered sections, with face
                        widths that vary according to the tower's height and load capacity. Rest
                        platforms should be provided at intervals of 20 meters, and work platforms
                        should be provided at all heights where antennas are to be installed. The tower
                        should also be equipped with a climbing ladder.
